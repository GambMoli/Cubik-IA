# Spec Delta

## Purpose

Defines the chat screen as a whole: how it is laid out, which states it shows (loading, error, empty, populated) and how it keeps the latest message in view.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Chat page layout
The chat page SHALL show the conversation inside a single bordered container that fills the available height, with the messages area above and the composer pinned below it.

#### Scenario: Opening the chat page
- **WHEN** a user opens the chat page
- **THEN** one bordered container is shown with the messages area on top and the composer at the bottom

#### Scenario: Long conversation
- **WHEN** the messages do not fit in the available height
- **THEN** only the messages area scrolls and the composer stays visible

### Requirement: Page spacing adapts to screen width
The chat page SHALL use smaller outer and inner padding on narrow screens than on wide screens.

#### Scenario: Phone width
- **WHEN** the viewport is narrower than the medium breakpoint
- **THEN** the page and the messages area use the compact padding

#### Scenario: Desktop width
- **WHEN** the viewport is at or above the medium breakpoint
- **THEN** the page and the messages area use the wider padding

### Requirement: Empty conversation shows a welcome message
When the conversation has no messages, the messages area SHALL show an assistant welcome message introducing Cubik IA and inviting the user to ask a math question.

#### Scenario: Conversation without messages
- **WHEN** the conversation contains no messages and is not loading
- **THEN** the welcome message is displayed with the assistant avatar

#### Scenario: First message sent
- **WHEN** the first message is added to the conversation
- **THEN** the welcome message is no longer shown

### Requirement: Loading state
While the conversation is loading, the messages area SHALL show the text "Cargando conversación..." centered, instead of messages or the welcome message.

#### Scenario: Conversation loading
- **WHEN** the page is told the conversation is loading
- **THEN** the loading text is shown centered in the messages area and no messages are shown

### Requirement: Error banner
The chat page SHALL show an error banner above the conversation container when an error message is provided, and no banner otherwise.

#### Scenario: Error present
- **WHEN** an error message is provided to the page
- **THEN** a banner with that message is displayed above the container

#### Scenario: No error
- **WHEN** no error message is provided
- **THEN** no banner is displayed and no space is reserved for it

### Requirement: Latest message stays in view
The chat page SHALL scroll the messages area so the newest message is visible: instantly when messages are first displayed, and smoothly when a new message is added.

#### Scenario: Opening a conversation with messages
- **WHEN** messages are displayed for the first time
- **THEN** the messages area is positioned at the last message without animation

#### Scenario: New message added
- **WHEN** a message is appended to the conversation
- **THEN** the messages area scrolls smoothly until that message is visible

### Requirement: Page does not depend on a backend
The chat page SHALL render and respond to input using only the data and callbacks it is given, and SHALL NOT send requests to a backend itself.

#### Scenario: Opening the page with no backend available
- **WHEN** the chat page is opened and no backend is running
- **THEN** it renders completely and no backend request is attempted
